				<h2>What is Jsonary?</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<p>Jsonary is a library for quickly building JSON-based AJAX clients, particularly for APIs that are described by <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>.
					<p>Schemas not only places constraints on the data, but can also define hyperlinks.  An API correctly described with JSON Schema can be navigated using these hyperlinks.  Jsonary uses the hyperlinks (along with any meta-data in the schema) to provide a "universal client" framework, allowing customisation for extra requirements such as OAuth tokens.
					<p>Each JSON Schema also has a URI, so it is possible to add renderers for particular parts of the API, so that the "universal client" can be easily adapted to provide a custom user-interface.
				</div>
				
				<h2>What is JSON Schema?</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<p>JSON Schema is a format for describing JSON data.  It can restrict the form that the data can take (for instance, requiring/banning properties, minimum/maximum numeric values, etc.) as well as providing useful extra information, such as hyperlinks, or documentation.  The main site is <a href="http://json-schema.org/">json-schema.org</a>.
					<p>Schemas can reference/link to other schemas, and specify complex behaviours - for example, conditional schemas that only apply if a particular property is present, or lists of sub-schemas of which only one may apply.
					<p>If you want to understand more about JSON Schema, <a href="documentation/json-schema/">this page</a> provides documentation for the format, along with interactive examples for various keywords.
