				<h2>What is Jsonary?</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<p>Jsonary is a library for quickly building JSON-based AJAX clients, particularly for APIs that are described by <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>.
					<p>Schemas not only places constraints on the data, but can also define hyperlinks.  An API correctly described with JSON Schema can be navigated using these hyperlinks.  Jsonary uses the hyperlinks (along with any meta-data in the schema) to provide a "universal client" framework, allowing customisation for extra requirements such as OAuth tokens.
					<p>Each JSON Schema also has a URI, so it is possible to add renderers for particular parts of the API, so that the "universal client" can be easily adapted to provide a custom user-interface.
				</div>

				<h2>Tour of basic features</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<p>There is a tour of some of the main features of Jsonary on <a href="feature-tour/">this page</a>.
					<p>It is not a complete catalog of the API - that is coming soon.
				</div>

				<h2>Walkthroughs</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<p>There are some walkthroughs, that show some use cases for Jsonary.
					<ul>
						<li><a href="walkthrough-basic/">Creating a generic JSON browser</a></li>
						<li><a href="walkthrough-facebook/">Creating a Facebook client</a></li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<h2>Tests</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<p>There are some <a href="tests/?all">tests</a> for Jsonary, however, they only work on a server with PHP (so they won't run if you're reading this on GitHub).
				</div>
				
				<h2>License</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<p>Jsonary is licensed under the <a href="LICENSE.txt">MIT License</a> (the same as jQuery).
