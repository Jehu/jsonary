				"Jsonary is a library that deals with [JSON (Hyper-)Schema](http://json-schema.org/).\n\nIt takes away all the detail of interpreting schemas and hyper-links, leaving you with a full hypermedia interpretation of your JSON data.\n\nJsonary also includes a rendering system, so you can embed your JSON data into web pages in a fully customisable way.\n",
				{
					"title": "Why should I use it?",
					"content": [
						"[JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/) can describe your existing JSON format/API as hypermedia: links, forms, multimedia interpretations, the whole deal.\n\nBy building your JSON client using Jsonary, your client can take all its hypertext cues from the schema - and less hard-coded knowledge in the client means more flexibility.\n"
