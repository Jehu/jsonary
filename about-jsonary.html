				<div class="tagline">What can it do?  Why should I care?</div>

				<h2>Main goals</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<p>The main goal of the project is to simplify writing clients for JSON APIs that are described by JSON (Hyper-)Schema.
					
					<p>Because Jsonary makes it so easy to create adaptive clients, it is also useful for debugging while the API is still being developed.  The debugging client can be modified into a full production client as development progresses.
				</div>

				<h2>What does it give me?</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<h3>1. A schema-aware wrapper</h3>

					<p>At its core, Jsonary provides a schema-aware wrapper for JSON data.  Data can be editable or read-only, and have any number of schemas assigned to it.

					<p>These data wrappers can be queried to find out:
					<ul>
					    <li>which schemas are currently describing the data</li>
					    <li>what hyper-links are currently defined</li>
					    <li>what structural/validation constraints the schemas place upon the data</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Complex behaviours (such as schema selection using "oneOf"/"anyOf") are handled by Jsonary - if the data changes, the schemas change appropriately.

					<h3>2. Hyper-links and AJAX</h3>

					<p>When JSON data is fetched through Jsonary, it checks for the "profile=" parameter of "Content-Type".  So if you are sending appropriate headers, the data will arrive with the correct schemas already applied.

					<p>Jsonary also makes it easy to deal with the hyper-links that are defined for data.  It finds the link definitions in the applicable hyper-schemas, and automatically fills out the URI templates.  These hyper-links can then be inspected to see:
					<ul>
					    <li>hypertext reference ("href") URL</li>
					    <li>link relation ("rel")</li>
					    <li>method (for HTTP)</li>
					    <li>schemas for user-supplied data to be submitted along with the link</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Hyper-links can also simply be followed, using the follow() method.  An appropriate AJAX request is made, and "link handlers" are called before and after the request is sent that can modify, cancel or respond to the request.

					<h3>3. Displaying/editing JSON data</h3>

					<p>Jsonary comes bundled with a rendering system, where the interface depends on the schemas describing the data being rendered.

					<p>For editable data, the default set of renderers pays attention to the schemas describing the data, and the constraints those schemas specify.  You can see how the default renderers respond to various JSON Schema keywords on <a href="http://jsonary.com/documentation/json-schema/">this page</a>, or try it out with your own schemas <a href="http://jsonary.com/demos/index-input.html">here</a>.
				</div>
				
				<h2>How does this help me debug my API, or build my client?</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<p>Because the data can be inspected for schemas and hyper-links, the nature of the API doesn’t have to be coded into the client.  The client can just follow the hyper-links provided from the schemas.

					<p>In fact, the default renderers provide a simple interface for following links, including links that require user-inputted data.  So a lot the work is done for you - one of the demos/tutorials on the is creating a "<a href="http://jsonary.com/demos/">generic client</a>" which takes all of its cues from the server, in less than 100 lines of HTML+JavaScript.

					<p>Jsonary also allows you to claim responsibility for displaying data of certain types, or with particular schemas describing it, as well as providing link handlers for specific links.  So once you have a fully-functional (but ugly) debugging client for your API, you can improve the UI piece-by-piece, all the time maintaining the complete flexibility of the debugging client.
				</div>
				
				<h2>What doesn't it do?</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<p>It is not primarily intended as a validator.  It includes some validator functionality (hidden away inside it) because that is necessary for things such as the "oneOf" keyword.

					<p>Mostly, though its main concern is correctly assigning schemas to data, allowing hyper-links/constraints to be inspected, and providing a UI that adapts to the data/schemas supplied by the server.
				</div>

				
				<h2>What are the plans for the future?</h2>
				<div class="section">
					<h3>1. Documentation</h3>

					<p>The documentation could be improved.  There are a few walkthroughs on the site, and an interactive API listing <a href="http://jsonary.com/demos/index-plain.html#../api/">here</a>, but it could be better.

					<h3>2. Node.js support</h3>

					<p>Although it’s entirely written in JavaScript, the Jsonary rendering system is built on a principle of progressive enhancement.  Renderers can output interfaces using HTML (including clickable links for actions, or callbacks when inputs change value), and then modify the DOM afterwards to get more advanced behaviour.

					<p>This was done for a couple of reasons -  partly, it’s often simpler to write out HTML than create the entire UI using the DOM, even with jQuery.

					<p>But it also gives us an exciting possibility - using Jsonary to produce an HTML-only interface in Node.js, while also using Jsonary to provide a fancy AJAX client for those that support it.  The dream is for Node.js developers to be able to write a their client once, and have it run server- or client-side as appropriate.

					<p>It doesn’t exist yet, but support for running Jsonary server-side using Node.js is most definitely planned.
