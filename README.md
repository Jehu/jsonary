Jsonary
=======

Jsonary is a wrapper for JSON data.  It presents an interface for monitoring data changes, and deals with JSON Schema (http://json-schema.org/).

The primary goal of this library is not validation of data, but rather to simplify the fetching and handling of data.  Its main focus is correctly assigning JSON Schema to data.

On its own, this library is not very exciting.  There is a second project, called Render.Jsonary.  Render.Jsonary extends Jsonary, to simplify writing AJAX clients in Javascript.
