# Jsonary

Jsonary is a wrapper for JSON data, that deals with [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/).

The primary goal of this library is not validation of data, but rather to simplify the fetching, handling and rendering of data.  Its focus is correctly assigning JSON Schema to data, which can then be used to select and inform user-interfaces.
